# Surfs Up

## Overview
The idea of this project was to provide a hypothetical investor with temperature data that proves that a Shaved Ice and Surf shop could sustain busines on Oahu year round.  The goal is to show data from 2010 to 2017 that displays temperatures worth of shaved ice and surfing.  If the results seem reasonable, then the investor will agree to push the project forward.

## Results
<ul>
  <li> <b>These are the tables that show basic statistics of the temperature data for each month from 2010 to 2017: </b>
    <p align ="center">
      <img src = "/Resources/june_temps.png" alt = "June Temperatures" width = "25%" title ="Jubne Temperatures">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <img src ="/Resources/december_temps.png" alt = "December Temperatures" width = "30%" title = "December Temperatures"> 
     </p>
  </li>As you can see, the data is pretty constant throughout both tables with only a few degrees difference throughout.  The biggest difference is between the minimums where Decembers minimum temperature is 56 and Junes is 64.  </li>
  </li>Other than the 8 degree difference ebtween minimums, the rest of the stats are abotu 3 degrees lower in December than in June </li>
</ul>

## Summary
The temperature differences don't seem that significant especially since the highs are around the same.  The low temperature in december are probably mostly at night which would not be a time when this shop is most likely open for business.  Althouygh the temperatures would not be considered bad surfing or shaved ice weather, one of the biggest issues with hawaiian weather in the winter is the rain, so adding a query for precipitation in the same months is important.
   <p align ="center">
      <img src = "/Resources/june_precip.png" alt = "June Temperatures" width = "25%" title ="June Precipitation">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <img src ="/Resources/december_precip.png" alt = "December Precipitation" width = "30%" title = "December Precipitation"> 
   </p>
 As you can see from the above tables, the results of that query may look intimidating when you see the max precipitation for both, however, the mean is rather low, so odds are that these extremely high maxes of 4.43 in June and 6.42 in December are extremelky irregular.  Also, 50% of the data is below 0.03 in December and 0.02 in June.  The combination of this temperature and precipitation data indicates a relatively warm climate with some rain, but extreme rain doesn't occur on a regular basis.  Even when it does, the temperature is still pretty warm.
